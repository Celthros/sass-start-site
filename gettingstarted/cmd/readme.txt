learning basic commands

in this process I am creating a new folder structure and manually creating folders and files for my first time into command line structure.

ls command - list of folders/files

dir - directories

cd - change directory

cd .. change directory up a folder

switching back to desktop you can do cd desk and tab to auto fill.

clear - clears up command window

auto complete commands

mkdir - make a new directory

touch - next this command create individual files. you can have multiple files created at once with  just bases between "touch script.js index.js test.js"

cp - copy, allows me to copy a file and move it to another part in the directory. I used "cp index.js .."

mv - move 0 lets me move files to some place else

rm/del - these commands delete items/files following a space and file/directory name.
rm - for mac and linux
del - for windows

rm -r : for deleting directories the -r stand for recursive.


overall this creates a basic understanding of how to navigate through the command line and create files and directories.
